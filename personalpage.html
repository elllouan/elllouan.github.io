                            <p>This podcast treats every possible topic and is aimed at literally everybody that is curious.
                            From history, to sciences passing by social topics, this podcast is a treasure-trove of knowledge and is animated by a team of funny and competent journalists.
                            You will not get bored with them, that's for sure!

                        <li style="margin-top: 1rem;">Thinkerview (French)
                            <p>This podcast treats societal-related topics, such as geopolitical relationships, industry, social and environmental crisis and so-forth .
                            An interviewer named "Sky", invites high-profile and competent expert to discuss ongoing issues and possible solutions.
                            Interviews vary in lentgh but mostly last at least 1h 30min. This podcast beaches the traditional rules of medias.
                            It actually takes the time to explore its topics in depth and it is excellent to build a more concrete/accurate vision of what is happening around us (mostly in France and to some extent also at an international level).
                            I would say that this podcast is aimed at people who want to build a more reliable and solid knowledge of the current problems and solutions.

                            <p>This podcast treats every possible topic and is aimed at literally everybody that is curious.
                            From history, to sciences passing by social topics, this podcast is a treasure-trove of knowledge and is animated by a team of funny and competent journalists.

                        <li style="margin-top: 2rem;">MÃ©ta De Choc (French)
                            <p>This podcast treats critical thinking applied to oneself. It gives tools to analyze and comprehend what we think, how we think it and why we think it. 
                            The podcast is run by a woman whose name is "". She invites people to testify from their past experiences and, through them, argue the traps or biaises involved.
                            I highly recommend this podcast because I do think that nowadays it has never been so relevant to be able to protect oneself from and identify biaises, false reasoning.
