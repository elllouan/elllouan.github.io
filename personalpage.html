                                <li style="margin-top: 1rem;"> <h3>Thinkerview</h3> (French) </li>
                                    <p>This podcast treats societal-related topics, such as geopolitical relationships, industry, social and environmental crisis and so-forth.
                                    An interviewer named "Sky" invites high-profile experts to discuss ongoing issues and possible solutions.
                                    This podcast's purpose is to give time to the interviewee to express himself, thereby breaking the traditional rules of medias
                                    Interviews vary in lentgh but mostly last at least 1h 30min.
                                    It actually takes the time to explore its topics in depth and it is excellent to build a more concrete and accurate vision of what is 
                                    happening around us (mostly in France but also at an international level).
                                    I would say that this podcast is aimed at people who want to build a more reliable and solid knowledge of the current problems and solutions.

                                    <p>This podcast treats critical thinking applied to oneself. It gives tools to analyze and comprehend what we think, how we think it and why we think it. 
                                    The podcast is run by a woman whose name is "". She invites people to testify from their past experiences and, through them, argue the traps or biaises involved.
                                    I highly recommend this podcast because I do think that nowadays it has never been so relevant to be able to protect oneself from and identify biaises, false reasoning.
