                <h3>On this page, I share my experience at the <span class="bold">Ocean Hackathon 2023</span> (8th edition). This is still being updated.</h3>
            </div>

                <div> <h3>What is Ocean Hackathon?</h3>
                    <div class="illustration-horiz" style="gap: 150px;">
                        <p>The Ocean Hackathon is a 48-hour international event during which several teams work on challenges related to the marine environment.
                            This event is held in several cities in France and abroad. Some challenges holders publish their project for the event.
                            The goal is to develop a prototype in order to bring a solution to the problematics. For this new edition, I applied for and participated in a project realted to plankton.

                <div> <h3>The project</h3>
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 100px;">
                        <div>
                            <p>The project originates from <span class="bold">Thibault Pollina</span>. He has co-founded a small company called <span class="bold">Fairscope</span>, which develops, produces and sells
                                its own low-cost microscopes. This microscope, called <span class="bold">PlanktoVision</span>, is basically aimed at public institutions and is designed for analyzing plankton samples.
                                The sample follows a series of steps after having taken from the sea:
                            </p>
                            <div class="frame-highlight">
                                <li> <span class="bold">Data acquisition:</span> the user takes several images of the sample.</li>
                                <li> <span class="bold">Data Segmentation:</span> an automated program segments the objects in the image.</li>
                                <li> <span class="bold">Data classification:</span> similar objects are classified by hand and then uploaded on <span class="bold">Ecotaxa</span>.</li>
                            </div>
                            <p>The purpose of this week-end was to add value to the existing data process by adding a <span class="bold">visualization</span> step between the <span class="bold">segmentation</span>
                                and the <span class="bold">classification</span> steps. The idea was to create an <span class="bold">intuitive, interactive and targeted</span> visualization platform so that anyone who take a sample
                                of water can understand quickly the composition of the sample. Also, it has been thought to automate the process of classification by using <span class="bold">machine learning</span> algorithms. 
                            </p>
                            <p>On the business/science side, the idea was to expand the target of the microscope to <span class="bold">private companies</span>, <span class="bold">private individuals</span> (participative sciences) and <span class="bold">academic structures</span>.
                                Eventually, the goal was to make the microscope more <span class="bold">accessible</span> to everyone and the data more <span class="bold">understandable</span>.

                <div> <h3>The team</h3>
                    <p>The project was carried out by a team of 12 people. We split the team into 3 groups: the <span class="bold">devs</span>, <span class="bold">bioscientists</span> and <span class="bold">designers</span>.
                        The <span class="bold">devs</span> were assigned to test different visualization techniques and classification techniques.
                        The <span class="bold">bioscientists</span> were assigned to determine the new opportunities this new feature would bring to the current bio problematics (targets, needs).
                        The <span class="bold">designers</span> were assigned to handle everything that was pitch and deliverable-related.

                <div> <h3>My expectations</h3>
                    <p>I join this event and more specifically this project because I want to learn more about <span class="bold">image processing and machine learning</span>. I had also participated in the previous edition,
                        therefore I knew this is a great opportunity to meet and learn from <span class="bold">fascinating, passionate and motivated</span> people.
                        At last, I also want to educate myself on the <span class="bold">current stakes faced by the marine environment</span>.

            <div> <h2>Technical part</h2>
                <div> <h3>Task understanding</h3>
                    <p>In the dev group, we assigned each member of the group a task to explore <span class="bold">different visualization approaches</span>. The goal was to find an intuitive and fast ways to analyze the composition of a sample.
                        I and another student were assigned to testing UMAP. <span class="bold">UMAP</span> is a dimensional-reduction model and let me trying to clarify the purpose of this tool.
                        Each object identified in the sample by the program (in the segmentation part), has a series of <span class="bold">features</span> (96 to be precise).
                        However, we want to be able to visualize (so with our eyes) the different plankton species contained within this sample.
                        To do so, we need a <span class="bold">dimensional-reduction model</span> that can picture distances between objects from a 96-dimension space into a 2D or 3D space. Indeed, as human-being we cannot see over a 3D space.
                        Based upon the features we give it, UMAP figures out a way to modelize in a 2D graph the repartition of objects (points) from a 96D space. Therefore, the X and Y axes are not meaningful anymore.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <hr>
                <div> <h3>Procedure</h3>
                    <div> <h5>Data acquisition and preprocessing</h5>
                        <p>We used examples of sample files (.tsv). Each sample file contained several hundreds of objects, each being represented with 96 features.</p>
                        <p>Among the data we were provided with, there were a <span class="bold">lot of features that were not relevant</span> for our aim. For example, meta-data such as the date, the person, the location, etc. were not useful.
                            Instead, we searched for features that <span class="bold">described the object image</span> such as the height, width, color, area covered, etc. We ended up with 29 features instead of 96.
                            Then, we had to dispose of all objects that were not plantkon. Indeed, when segmentation the program can identify objects that are not plankton such as detritus.
                            We started with a dataset of 2264 objects segmented and 96 features for each. After having reduced the number of features and objects, we finally had a dataset of 1173 objects and 29 features for each.
                            This work of <span class="bold">data acquisition</span> is essential in data processing as it prevents from <span class="bold">expensive and unnecessary</span> computations later.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div> <h5>Feeding the model</h5>
                        <p>Now, with this much cleaner dataset we can start experimenting UMAP. You can consult my <a href="downloads/OceanHackathon2023.ipynb" download="">Google Colab notebook</a> if you wish (not very clean though).</p>
                        <p>The left graph below shows the repartition of the 5 most present species in this dataset (from 0 the most present to 4 the least present).
                            We can see 4 clear clusters (red, orange, green and brown). However, the gray points are quite intricated with the green ones. These species are not clearly distinguishable.

                        </p>
                        <p>To clusterized points, we used the <span class="bold">K-Mean</span> method. We expected the result to be uncorrect because the gray points were really close to the green ones.
                            To improve this and have a better distinction between clusters of species, we could have modified <span class="bold">hyperparameters</span> of the UMAP models. Unfortunaetly, we did not have time to go further.
                            The right picture shows what we were aiming at.

            <div> <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Once again, this <span class="bold">Ocean Hackathon</span> experience was rich. I could learn from my more-experienced developer teammates, namely <span class="bold">Angueran, Gwenn, Matthieu</span>.
                    Additionally, I gained valuable insights and practical experience working on a <span class="bold">real-world application</span>.
                    As for the technical part, I am satisfied as well. I could learn more about <span class="bold">image processing</span>, more precisely about the <span class="bold">data visualization</span> part.
                    <span class="bold">Overall, this edition was a success and I am looking forward to the next one!</span>
