                <div> <h3>What is Ocean Hackathon?</h3>
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 150px;">
                        <p style="margin: auto; width: 200%;">The Ocean Hackathon is a 48-hour international event during which several teams work on challenges related to the marine environment. This event is held in several cities in France and abroad. 
                            Some challenges holders publish their project for the event. The goal is to develop a prototype in order to bring a solution to the problematics. For this new edition, I applied for and participated in a project realted to plankton.

                <div> <h3>The project</h3>
                    <div style="display: flex; flex-direction: row; gap: 150px;">
                        <p style="margin: auto; width: 200%;">The project originates from <span class="bold">Thibault Pollina</span>. He has co-founded a small company called <span class="bold">Fairscope</span>, which develops, produces and sells
                            its own low-cost microscopes. This microscope, called <span class="bold">PlanktoVision</span>, is basically aimed at public institutions and is designed for analyzing plankton samples.
                        </p>

                    </div>
                        The sample follows a series of steps after having taken from the sea:
                    </p>
                    <div class="frame-highlight">
                        <li>Data acquisition: the user takes several images of the sample.</li>
                        <li>Data Segmentation: an automated program segments objects in the image.</li>
                        <li>Data classification: similar objects are classified by hand and then uploaded on <span class="bold">Ecotaxa</span>.</li>
                    </div>
                    <p>The purpose of this week-end was to add value to the existing data process by adding a <span class="bold">visualization</span> step between the <span class="bold">segmentation</span>
                        and the <span class="bold">classification</span> steps. The idea was to create an <span class="bold">intuitive, interactive and targeted</span> visualization platform so that anyone who take a sample
                        of water can understand quickly the composition of the sample. Also, it has been thought to automate the process of classification by using <span class="bold">machine learning</span> algorithms. 
                    </p>
                    <p>On the business/science side, the idea was to expand the target of the microscope to <span class="bold">private companies</span>, <span class="bold">private individuals</span> (participative sciences) and <span class="bold">academic structures</span>.
                        Eventually, the goal was to make the microscope more <span class="bold">accessible</span> to everyone and the data more <span class="bold">understandable</span>.

                <div> <h3>The team</h3>
                    <p>The project was carried out by a team of 12 people. We split the team into 3 groups: the <span class="bold">devs</span>, <span class="bold">bioscientists</span> and <span class="bold">designers</span>.
                        The <span class="bold">devs</span> were assigned to test different visualization techniques and classification techniques.
                        The <span class="bold">bioscientists</span> were assigned to determine the new opportunities this new feature would bring to the current bio problematics (targets, needs).
                        The <span class="bold">designers</span> were assigned to handle everything that was pitch and deliverable-related.

                <div> <h3>My expectations</h3>
                    <p>I join this event and more specifically this project because I want to learn more about <span class="bold">image processing and machine learning</span>. I had also participated in the previous edition,
                        therefore I knew this is a great opportunity to meet and learn from <span class="bold">fascinating, passionate and motivated</span> people.
                        At last, I also want to educate myself on the <span class="bold">current stakes faced by the marine environment</span>.

            </div>

            <div> <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>Once again, this <span class="bold">Ocean Hackathon</span> experience was rich. I could learn from my more-experienced developer teammates, namely <span class="bold">Angueran, Gwenn, Matthieu</span>.
                    Additionally, I gained valuable insights and practical experience working on a <span class="bold">real-world application</span>.
                    As for the technical part, I am satisfied as well. I could learn more about <span class="bold">image processing</span>, more precisely about the <span class="bold">data visualization</span> part.
                    <span class="bold">Overall, this edition was a success and I am looking forward to the next one!</span>
