                    <div class="content">
                        <p>This course gives an understanding on how we numerize a signal, what are the impacts and how we can elaborate a digital filter to filter an analog signal.</p>

                            <div> <h4>1. Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and Analog Filter Synthesis</h4>
                                <p>With a view to processing digital signals, we need to turn a continuous (or analog) signal into a discrete signal
                                    that consists of a finite number of samples that can be handled by a processor. Therefore, we use the DFT, let's remind us quickly of that. </p>
                                <div class="frame-highlight">
                                    <ol>
                                        <li> <span class="bold">Sampling & Quantification:</span>            turns the continuous signal into a discrete signal.</li>
                                        <li> <span class="bold">Temporal truncation of the signal:</span>    get an finite amount of samplings.</li>
                                        <li> <span class="bold">Spectral discretization:</span>              turns the continuous spectrum into a discrete spectrum.</li>

                                </div>
                                <p>However, each one of these steps has an impact on the signal. Indeed, discretizing a signal is not without consequences and some parameters should be chosen wisely
                                    to avoid aliasing and other artifacts.</p>

                            <div>
                                <p>There exists 2 types of digital filters: <span class="mark">IIR (Infinite Impulse Response)</span> and <span class="mark">FIR (Finite Impulse Response)</span>.</p>
                                <ul>
                                    <div class="frame-highlight">
                                        <li> <span class="mark">IIR:</span> the output depends on the current and previous inputs and outputs > <span class="math">\( s[n] = \sum_{i=0}^{M-1}{a_i e[i]} + \sum_{j=0}^{N-1}{a_i s[n-i]} \)</span></li>
                                        <p>The purpose of this method is to determine the equivalent digital form \( H(z) \) (\(z\)-domain) of the analog template filter \( H(p) \). From there, we can deduce the <span class="bold">recursive algorithm \( s[n] \)</span> 
                                            that will implement the digital filter.
                                            This method is <span class="bold">more accurate</span> and will be generally preferred over the RIF method. However, the analog filter must meet some requirements to be feasible (stability).</p>
                                        <p> - <span class="bold">Invariance of the Impulse Response:</span> This method consists of starting with an analog template </p>
                                        <p> - <span class="bold">Discretization of the inverse DFT:</span> </p>
                                        <p>All in all, this method has some benefits - <span class="bold">more selective, faster and requires only a few memory registers</span> - and some drawbacks - <span class="bold">can be unstable (poles), non-linear phase</span>.</p>

                                        <p>The purpose of this method is to determine an <span class="bold">approximation of the filter's impulse response</span> and then convolute it with the input signal.
                                            As we consider only an approximation, the <span class="bold">filter's characteristics get modified</span> and we have to deal with some drawbacks such as the

                                        <p>Hubs are dumb, they broadcast all messages, therfore it is very easy to eavesdrop the network traffic and it reduces the bandwith.
                                            Switchs are smart, they only broadcast the messages to the targeted host, therefore it is more secure and it increases the bandwith.</p>

                                        <p>ICMP is a protocol implemented on the network (3rd) layer where the IP address lies.
                                            ARP is a protocol that matches an MAC (datalink layer) with an IP address (network layer) within an ARP table.
                                            This protocol is used when a host sends data to an IP address </p>

                            <p>In this lab session, we set up a network of PCs that consisted of several switchs :</p>

                                        <p>When a packet is sent to a router, the dest MAC is the router's and the dest IP is the targeted host on the network.
                                            When it is forwarded by the router, the src MAC is the router's and the src IP initial host's.</p>

                                        <p>When a packet is sent, the TTL is set to 64. Each time the packet is forwarded, the TTL is decremented by 1.
                                            If the TTL reaches 0, the packet is dropped and an ICMP message is sent to the initial host.</p>
