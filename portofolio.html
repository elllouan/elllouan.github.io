            <h1 class="portofolio-title">PORTOFOLIO</h1>

            <p>This is my portofolio. It lists my most important experiences. Within this section, I aim at describing some of my personal, 
            academic and professional achievements, and most importantly, what I learnt from them.</p>

            <h2>Work philosophy</h2>
            <p>First off, I would like to introduce my goals. As I am entering my fourth year in my engineering studies, 
            I realised that I needed to bring more tangibility into my work by documenting it. My mindset could be summarized in these words:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Curiosity: Especially for the fields of electronics and computer engineering.</li>
                <li>Proactivity: Being inquisitive and asking for feedback.</li>
                <li>Resourceful: Being able to self-teach or make effective researchs on subjects or topics when necessary.</li>
                <li>Persistence: Trying as much as possible to build a deep and long-term knowledge.</li>
                <li>Reflective: Leveraging my past experiences to serve better my current purpose. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I wish to steer my studies more in the field of embedded systems.
            I am really interested in signal processing (my major this year), control theory, low-level programmation and electronics.
            In parallel to my engineering studies, I will also be studying management (MAE) for the next 2 years at the Brest IAE as part of a double-diploma master cursus.
            By doing so, I yearn to expand my skills beyond my technical and scientific knowledge.
            Nowadays, I think that an enginner should also be considering social skills as they are essential in enhancing team work, well-being, performance and productivity.</p>

            <h2>Experiences</h2>

            <p>Along my studies, I have worked out different experiences that gave me the opportunity to build more confidence and new skills.
            I have participated in the 2022 edition of the Ocean Hackathon. Altogether with the team we worked on a CO2-tracking application. You can click here for more detais.
            I studied one semester in the Netherlands at Fontys University of Applied Sciences. You can click here for more details.
            I worked for the whole summer at a Haption, which is a robotics company specialized in the development of force-feedback devices. 
                You can click <a href="haption.html">here</a> for more details about my mission there.</p>
