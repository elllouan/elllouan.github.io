            <div><h3 id="syscalls">2. Syscalls</h3>
                <p>To understand syscalls, we must understand the difference between the <span class="mark">user session and the kernel</span>. Basically, when we run any application or software
                    on our computer, we are located in the user session, meaning that we have restricted privilieges. But most of the time, the program (software) needs to perform
                    or have access to some stuffs that require the use of the kernel. The application would then issue a <span class="mark">syscall</span> to request the OS for higher services.
                    Hence, the OS comes <span class="mark">between the user-level program (session) and the hardware</span>. The <span class="mark">kernel</span> is the low-level part of the OS that has access to all the resources of the computer.
                    It handles essential resources such as process management (priorities, round-robin), memory management (data allocation), device-driver management and syscall handling.
                    It coordinates all the prgrams by deciding which one is the most urgent and providing resources accordingly. Having access to the kernel means having the highest privileges.
                    In Ubuntu, when we issue the <span class="mark">sudo</span> command, we are asking for kernel privileges.
                </p>
                <p>We work with the platform MCUXpresso IDE,  and will build targets for the Cortex-M33 CPU. 

                </p>
                <div><h4>2.1 Handler/Thread modes</h4>
                    <p>By default, when we run a task (or thread), we are in a <span class="mark">Unprivileged Thread</span> mode.
                        To trigger a syscall, we need to call a function implemented in the OS library (like os_alloc). This function will then
                        call the <span class="mark">SVC (SuperVisor Call)</span> followed by a number, which refers to the type of syscall requested (1 for os_alloc).
                        This call is operated in assembly code, and will branch to the <span class="mark">SVC_Handler</span> function in the OS kernel (svc.s).
                        This function executes the C code related to the syscall (svc_dispatch) and then returns to the user session. The instruction __ASM volatile("...") injects
                        assembly code. 
                    </p>

                    </div>
                    <p>At this point, we are in the <span class="mark">Privileged Handler</span> mode. This mode can not be interrupted and is used to dispatch (svc_dispatch)
                        the syscall to the right process (regarding the svc number). Below, the argument n represents the svc number and the argument args[] points to the
                        <a href="#2.2">MSP</a> .

                    <p>The <span class="mark">MSP</span> (Main Stack Pointer) and <span class="mark">PSP</span> (Process Stack Pointer) are registers which respectively point to the ... in Handler or Thread mode.
