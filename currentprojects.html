                                <p>In this project, our goal is to develop an embedded scripting calculator on a NXP microcontroller.
                                We have the PC that can communicate with the NXP board over UART. From the PC, we open a serial communication and input math operation commands.
                                These are received by the microcontroller which interprets them.
                                Therefore, we use a C library called <span class="mark">Calc</span> that can be integrated in a microcontroller.
                                This library was developed to perform arithmetic operations using a scripting approach like Matlab. The board has already some of the code
                                implemented in it. This project organises itself around three tasks:</p>

                                <div class="task1-1"> <h4>1. VT100 code</h4>
                                    <p>Historically, a terminal could only interpret keyboards that would output printing characters. In that matter, the VT100 (or ANSI escape sequences)
                                        were invented so that a terminal could also interpret non-printing characters such as arrow cursors or f keyboards. With this new standard was
                                        introduced brand new features and we could now move the cursor, clear the screen, change the color of the text, etc.
                                        In this project, the terminal on the laptop's end sends characters to the board that are sent back so they can be visualized on the terminal.
                                        This way, when a VT100 characters sequence is sent to the board, we just need to send it back and the terminal will interpret it accordingly.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><span class="italic">sys_wait_key</span> is called by a Calc function. It returns <span class="italic">c</span> and modifies the <span class="italic">scan</span> pointer.
                                        <span class="italic">scan_t</span> is a enum type defined in the Calc header. Here we can see that this function gets the c character and depending on what characters it is we assigned to scan the right value.
                                        In the case of a VT100 sequence, the first character is an escape character (0x1B = 27). Since the function is quite long, I did not screenshot it entierly, though we can see the approach for the first sequences.

                                    <p>We want to be able to load files from the SD card and execute them and to do so, we need to mount a file system on the SD card. We were required to use
                                        the FAT32 file system. The FAT32 file system is a simple file system and is the most commonly used. It is part of the FAT family file system developed by Windows.
                                        A file system allows to arange memory space of a storage device such as an SD card, thereby providing a convenient way to naviguate through the memory, store and access data.
                                        The FAT32 library documentation is available at this <a href="http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html">link</a>.

                                        To do so, we need to implement basic syscalls-like features.
                                        Indeed, the Calc library makes available some commands that are meant for opening, closing, reading and writing files.
                                        My job here was to implement Calc functions using FAT32 functions.

                            <div> <h3>Convolution in probability and image processing</h3>
                                First off, I would like to mention this wonderful video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSGqQa5O-M" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a>.
                                There I learnt a lot and improve my understanding about the role that convolution plays in probability and image processing.
                                To get started, I will try to summarize quickly what it is explained in this video.
                                
                               <div> <h4>Discrete convolution</h4>
                                    <p>We can start by focusing on the discrete case which (in my opinion) brings the main idea of why we use convolution in probability.
                                        The formula goes \[ (f(n)*g(n))(s) = \sum^{N}_{n=0} f(n) g(s-n) \]
                                        Here \(f(n)\) and \(g(m)\) are functions representing the probability of a random discrete variable.
                                        So if we try to think this through, we can notice that a new variable appeared \(s\) and also we do this weird operation consisting of multiplying \(g(s-n)\) with \(f(n)\).
                                    </p>
                                    <p>Now let's image I want to determine the probability that 2 consecutive and independent events (let's say \( n+m=5 \)) occur.
                                        To be easier, let's consider that \(n\) and \(m\) are variables representing the face of a dice.
                                        We need to consider all possibilities, such as \(n=1\) and \(m=4\), \(n=2\) and \(m=3\) and so on. So we end up adding these probabilities:
                                        \(f(n=1) \times g(m=4) + f(n=2) \times g(m=3) + f(n=3) \times g(m=2) ... \). If we generalize this operation to all other possible combinaisons of events \( n+m=s \),
                                        where \(s\) can take any possible value an event can take (in our case, from 1 to 6).
                                        You may have understood it, \(s\) represents the combinaison of two successive and independent events \(n\) and \(m\). So to get back to the example,
                                        the probability that we get a total of 5 after having thrown the dice twice can be written as follows:
                                        \[ P(5) = \sum^{6}_{n=1} f(n) g(5-n) = f(n=1) \times g(m=4) + f(n=2) \times g(m=3) + ... + f(n=4) \times g(m=1) \]
                                        If we repeat this operation for each value of \(s\), we get a function of \(s\) where the image represents the probability that \(s=n+m\) occurs.

                                </div>
                                
                                <div> <h4>Continuous convolution</h4>
                                    <p>The formula goes \[ (f(x)*g(x))(s) = \int^{+\infty}_{-\infty} f(x) g(s-x) dx \]
                                        Here \(f(x)\) and \(g(y)\) are functions representing the probability density of a random variable.
                                        The outcome of this convolution operation is a new function \(h(s)\), called the probability density function,
                                        where \(s\) represents the random variable \(X+Y\) and its image represents the probability (density) that \(P_X + P_P\) occurs.
                                        The concept is basically the same, since we are in a contiuous set of random variables,
                                        we just expand the discrete case \(\sum\) to the continuous case \(\int\), which means we consider the area under the curve.

                                <p>This section is an introduction to TensorFlow. As stated before, I use Google Colab to get familiar with the tensorflow module.
                                    The purpose of this first part is to get more familiar with the concept of tensor and how to manipulate them using tensorflow.
                                    I have been introduced to these subjects:

                                <p>After having been through the main functionalities of TensorFlow, this is now the time to implement a concrete example.
                                    I will build a simple machine learning model based on linear regression in order to predict the price of a current car.
                                    For this, I have downloaded this <a href="">csv</a> file, which stores thousand different cars and their features.
                                    The model will predict, using the linear regression method, the likely price of a car given some of its features.
                                </p>

                            <hr>
                            <div> <h3>Neural Network Layers model</h3>
                                <p>A <span class="bold">neural network</span> consists of 3 parts: the <span class="bold">input layer</span>, the
                                    <span class="bold">hidden layer(s)</span> and the <span class="bold">output layer</span>. Now let's expand on each one of them.
                                </p>
                                <div> <h4>Layers</h4>
                                    <h5>Input layer</h5>
                                    <p>The <span class="bold">input layer</span> is the layer that gets our data. It allocates <span class="bold">1 neuron per input argument</span>.
                                        For example, an input argument for an image would be a pixel. <span class="bold">The dimension of the input layer amounts the dimension of the one input argument</span>.
                                        Each neuron of the input layer is connected to all neurons of the next layer, the <span class="bold">hidden layer</span>.
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Hidden layer</h5>
                                    <p>a <span class="bold">hidden layer</span> has no contact with the outside, unlike the input and output layers. It is the layer that processes the data.
                                        Each neuron of this layer gives a certain <span class="bold">weight</span> \( w_n \) to the input data, with \( n \) the dimension of the input data.
                                        The output of each neuron is the sum of all weighted inputs plus a bias \( b \) and the result is passed through an <span class="bold">activation function</span> (will come back to this later on).
                                        What comes out of each layer of a hidden layer is \( y = \sigma(w_1x_1 + w_2x_2 + ... + w_nx_n + b) \), with \( \sigma \) the activation function and \( y \) of dimension one.
                                        As for the input layer, each neuron of the hidden layer is connected to all neurons of the next layer, which may be another hidden layer or the <span class="bold">output layer</span>. 
                                    </p>
                                    <h5>Output layer</h5>
                                    <p>The <span class="bold">output layer</span> is the last layer of our model and </p>
                                    <p>The graph below depicts an overview of what a NNL look like.</p>

                                <div> <h4>Backpropagation</h4>
                                    <p>Though I have still troubles to grasp how this <span class="bold">backpropagation</span> works (it is on working progress haha). I understand
                                        things separately but ... well. I will try to explain what I have understood and also bring up what I am still struggling with.
                                        At each iteration (each time the model is fed with an input data \( X \)), it computes the loss (difference between prediction and truth) after having processed the data according to weights \( w_n \).
                                        For each neuron this would go as follows:
                                        \[ X = (x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 ... x_n) \rightarrow a_1 = \sigma(w_1 \cdot x_1+w_2 \cdot x_2+w_3 \cdot x_3+...+b) \]
                                        with \( a_1 \) the output of the neuron and \( \sigma \) the activation function.
                                        <div class="frame-highlight">
                                            <p>Already here, I am not sure about the activation function. I have seen several activation functions such as the sigmoid function, the ReLU function, etc.
                                                However I don't fully understand their purpose and why not other functions.
                                            </p>
                                        </div>
                                        <h5>Loss and Cost functions</h5>
                                        <p>Then, after going through all hidden layers, it reaches the output layer, where it computes the loss function. There exist different loss functions,
                                            such as the mean squared error (MSE), absolute error (AE), Huber, etc. For sake of simplicity, I will only consider the MSE. 
                                            \[ loss = \frac{1}{2}(y_{pred}-y_{true})^2 \]
                                            
                                        </p>

                                        <h5>Adjusting the weights</h5>
                                        <p>The idea is to compute the gradient of the Cost function (batch of data) with respect to the weights and biases of the model.
                                            
                                        </p>
                                        


                                       
                                    </p>
                                </div>

                            <p>In this project, I intend to build an OS from scratch. I want to leverage the knowledge I will acquire along the academic OS project to learn more about this topic.
                                Therefore, I started off this new OS journey to program a complete OS from scratch. I will be following the contents and tutos provided by <a href="https://wiki.osdev.org/Main_Page">OSDev.org</a>.
                                Also, I will be picking some information in this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHh55M_Kq4OApWScZyPl5HhgsTJS9MZ6M">Youtube series</a>.
