                                <p>In this project, we program an OS aimed at the Cortex-M33 processor. The purpose here is to understand how an OS works, what is a the difference between the kernel and the user.
                                    We want to be able to understand what happens in the background when we make a syscall.
                                    Here, I will only provide a brief overview about this project. However, you can find a more comprehensive view of it <a href="os_enib_project.html">there</a>.

                                <p>In this project, I intend to build an OS from scratch. I want to leverage the knowledge I will acquire along the academic project to learn more about this topic.
                                    I find it to be really interesting to be able to comprehend thoroughly what building an OS really requires, I mean the whole process.
                                    This will be a much harder task, as I will self-teach me most of the stuffs.

                                <p>In this project, our goal is to develop an embedded scripting calculator on a NXP microcontroller.
                                We have the PC that can communicate with the NXP board over UART. From the PC, we open a serial communication and input math operation commands.
                                These are received by the microcontroller which interprets them.
                                Therefore, we use a C library called <span class="mark">Calc</span> that can be integrated in a microcontroller.
                                This library was developed to perform arithmetic operations using a scripting approach like Matlab. The board has already some of the code
                                implemented in it. This project organises itself around three tasks:</p>

                                    <h3>1. VT100 code</h3>
                                    <p>Historically, a terminal could only interpret keyboards that would output printing characters. In that matter, the VT100 (or ANSI escape sequences)
                                        were invented so that a terminal could also interpret non-printing characters such as arrow cursors or f keyboards. With this new standard was
                                        introduced brand new features and we could now move the cursor, clear the screen, change the color of the text, etc.
                                        In this project, the terminal on the laptop's end sends characters to the board that are sent back so they can be visualized on the terminal.
                                        This way, when a VT100 characters sequence is sent to the board, we just need to send it back and the terminal will interpret it accordingly.
                                    </p>

                                    <p><span class="italic">sys_wait_key</span> is called by a Calc function. It returns <span class="italic">c</span> and modifies the <span class="italic">scan</span> pointer.
                                        <span class="italic">scan_t</span> is a enum type defined in the Calc header. Here we can see that this function gets the c character and depending on what characters it is we assigned to scan the right value.
                                        In the case of a VT100 sequence, the first character is an escape character (0x1B = 27). Since the function is quite long, I did not screenshot it entierly, though we can see the approach for the first sequences.

                                    <p>We want to be able to load files from the SD card and execute them and to do so, we need to mount a file system on the SD card. We were required to use
                                        the FAT32 file system. The FAT32 file system is a simple file system and is the most commonly used. It is part of the FAT family file system developed by Windows.
                                        A file system allows to arange memory space of a storage device such as an SD card, thereby providing a convenient way to naviguate through the memory, store and access data.
                                        The FAT32 library documentation is available at this <a href="http://elm-chan.org/fsw/ff/00index_e.html">link</a>.

                                    <p>Now that we can access with files stored on a SD card, we would like to be able to interact with them (modifying or executing them).
                                        To do so, we need to implement basic syscalls-like features.
                                        Indeed, the Calc library makes available some commands that are meant for opening, closing, reading and writing files.
                                        My job here was to implement Calc functions using FAT32 functions.

                                First off, I would like to mention this wonderful video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSGqQa5O-M" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a>.
                                There I learnt a lot and improve my understanding about the role that convolution plays in probability and image processing.
                                To get started, I will try to summarize quickly what it is explained in this video.
                                
                                <h4>Discrete convolution</h4>
                                <p>We can start by focusing on the discrete case which (in my opinion) brings the main idea of why we use convolution in probability.
                                    The formula goes \[ (f(n)*g(n))(s) = \sum^{N}_{n=0} f(n) g(s-n) \]
                                    Here \(f(n)\) and \(g(m)\) are functions representing the probability of a random discrete variable.
                                    So if we try to think this through, we can notice that a new variable appeared \(s\) and also we do this weird operation consisting of multiplying \(g(s-n)\) with \(f(n)\).
                                </p>
                                <p>Now let's image I want to determine the probability that 2 consecutive and independent events (let's say \( n+m=5 \)) occur.
                                    To be easier, let's consider that \(n\) and \(m\) are variables representing the face of a dice.
                                    We need to consider all possibilities, such as \(n=1\) and \(m=4\), \(n=2\) and \(m=3\) and so on. So we end up adding these probabilities:
                                    \(f(n=1) \times g(m=4) + f(n=2) \times g(m=3) + f(n=3) \times g(m=2) ... \). If we generalize this operation to all other possible combinaisons of events \( n+m=s \),
                                    where \(s\) can take any possible value an event can take (in our case, from 1 to 6).
                                    You may have understood it, \(s\) represents the combinaison of two successive and independent events \(n\) and \(m\). So to get back to the example,
                                    the probability that we get a total of 5 after having thrown the dice twice can be written as follows:
                                    \[ P(5) = \sum^{6}_{n=1} f(n) g(5-n) = f(n=1) \times g(m=4) + f(n=2) \times g(m=3) + ... + f(n=4) \times g(m=1) \]
                                    If we repeat this operation for each value of \(s\), we get a function of \(s\) where the image represents the probability that \(s=n+m\) occurs.
                                </p>
                                
                                
                                <h4>Continuous convolution</h4>
                                The formula goes \[ (f(x)*g(x))(s) = \int^{+\infty}_{-\infty} f(x) g(s-x) dx \]
                                Here \(f(x)\) and \(g(y)\) are functions representing the probability density of a random variable.
                                The outcome of this convolution operation is a new function \(h(s)\), called the probability density function,
                                where \(s\) represents the random variable \(X+Y\) and its image represents the probability (density) that \(P_X + P_P\) occurs.
                                The concept is basically the same, since we are in a contiuous set of random variables,
                                we just expand the discrete case \(\sum\) to the continuous case \(\int\), which means we consider the area under the curve.

                                <p>This section is an introduction to TensorFlow. As stated before, I use Google Colab to get familiar with the tensorflow module.
                                    The purpose of this first part is to get more familiar with the concept of tensor and how to manipulate them using tensorflow.
                                    I have been introduced to these subjects:

                                <p>After having been through the main functionalities of TensorFlow, this is now the time to implement a concrete example.
                                    I will build a simple machine learning model based on linear regression in order to predict the price of a current car.
                                    For this, I have downloaded this <a href="">csv</a> file, which stores thousand different cars and their features.
                                    The model will predict, using the linear regression method, the likely price of a car given some of its features.
