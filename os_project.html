                <div> <h3>1. Bootstrapping & Cross-compilation</h3>
                    <p>Our goal here is to build a GCC cross-compiler for the <span class="mark">i386-elf</span> target.
                        Therefore, I have to build binutils, gdb and gcc myself to set them for this configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="mark">Bootstrapping</span> is a process in which we use an older version of a compiler to compile its new version.
                        Hence, we start with a basic compiler (compiled with a native compiler) up to buidling a more advanced (and maybe self-hosted) compiler.
                        Bootstrapping is very interesting as it leverages previous features and achievements of a compiler to create a new and more advanced version of it.
                        Here is an illustration with the T-diagram:
                        <img src="images/bootstrapping.svg" alt="bootstrapping">
                        A <span class="mark">self-hosted</span> compiler is a compiler designed to compile its source programmation language.
                        A <span class="mark">cross-compiler</span> is a compiler whose purpose is to build executable programs (binary files) which are aimed at another OS or architecture
                        than the one we are working on. For example, if we work on a Linux environment but we want to create executables for Windows whose OS
                        (and maybe architecture) differs, we can use a cross-compiler (such as minGW-64) to do so.
                        <div class="frame-highlight">
                            <p>As an example, the GCC compiler is a cross-compiler that relies on bootstrapping. Thus, it can be configured to generate code on various
                            targets and architectures (using minGW-64 for Windows OS on a x64 architecture). On top of that, it supports a wide range of source langages such as C, C++, Fortran, Go, Pascal, Rust, etc.
                            This is due to its structure, which allows it to separate front-end (source syntax) and back-end (target syntax) code.
