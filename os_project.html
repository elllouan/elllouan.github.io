                <div> <h3>1.1 Definitions</h3>
                    <p>Our goal here is to build a GCC cross-compiler for the <span class="bold">i386-elf</span> target.
                        Therefore, I have to build binutils, gdb and gcc myself to set them for this configuration.
                    </p>
                    <p><span class="bold">Bootstrapping</span> is a process in which we use an older version of a compiler to compile its new version.
                        Hence, we start with a basic compiler (compiled with a native compiler) up to buidling a more advanced (and maybe self-hosted) compiler.
                        Bootstrapping is very interesting as it leverages previous features and achievements of a compiler to create a new and more advanced version of it.
                        Here is an illustration with the T-diagram:
                        <img src="images/bootstrapping.svg" alt="bootstrapping">
                        A <span class="bold">self-hosted</span> compiler is a compiler designed to compile its source programmation language.
                        A <span class="bold">cross-compiler</span> is a compiler whose purpose is to build executable programs (binary files) which are aimed at another OS or architecture
                        than the one we are working on. For example, if we work on a Linux environment but we want to create executables for Windows whose OS
                        (and maybe architecture) differs, we can use a cross-compiler (such as minGW-64) to do so.
                        <div class="frame-highlight">
                            <p>As an example, the GCC compiler is a cross-compiler that relies on bootstrapping. Thus, it can be configured to generate code on various
                            targets and architectures (using minGW-64 for Windows OS on a x64 architecture). On top of that, it supports a wide range of source langages such as C, C++, Fortran, Go, Pascal, Rust, etc.
                            This is due to its structure, which allows it to separate front-end (source syntax) and back-end (target syntax) code.

                    <p>I will be working with the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2) as my platform of developement.
                        <div class="frame-highlight">
                            <p><span class="bold">Note:</span> You cannot have your cross compiler in the /mnt/c/ (or /mnt/"x") areas, as trying to compile your cross-compiler there will generate errors, whereas building to $HOME/opt/cross works perfectly.
                                This is fixed with Windows Update KB3176929.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                        GCC is a comprehensive tool. It can be configured to compile code for various <span class="bold">targets</span> (platforms and architectures). Therefore, I will be using it. Some <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html">dependencies</a>
                        need to be installed before processing gcc compilation. First off, I need to configure and compile other tools that will be useful for the future of this project. These are <span class="bold">Binutils</span> and <span class="bold">GDB</span>.
                        Though, I don't fully understand what Binutils is used for. I have understood that it is a collection of GNU tools with the <span class="bold">ld</span> linker and <span class="bold">as</span> assembler.
                        On the other hand, GDB is a debugger. It will come handy when I will be debugging my OS.
                    </p>
                    <p>First, I start by setting some environment variables to make the process easier. <span class="bold">TARGET</span> is the target architecture, <span class="bold">PREFIX</span> is the path to my compiler's root directory.
                        This path can be changed. Finally, <span class="bold">PATH</span> is the path to the compiler binaries (or executable).

            <div class="kernel-tuto"> <h2>Basic kernel</h2>
                <div> <h3>Context</h3>
                    <p>Within the next paragraphs, I will endeavor to explain concisely, nonetheless clearly, how I am going to set up a <span class="bold">minimal kernel</span> for the <span class="bold">x86 architecture</span>. My goal here is to compile, link and run the kernel.
                        This first "version" of the kernel will simply print out a Hello World on the terminal. First off, let's clarify how the computer proceeds the <span class="bold">kernel loading</span> when it boots.
                    </p>
                    <div> <h5>Kernel loading and booting</h5>
                        <p>A computer uses 3 components to boot: the <span class="bold">BIOS</span>, the <span class="bold">bootloader</span> and the <span class="bold">kernel</span>.
                            When we turn on a computer, the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System) is the first program to be loaded into the <span class="bold">firmware RAM</span>. The CP register points to the BIOS code and executes it.
                            The BIOS then loads the <span class="bold">bootloader</span> into the RAM by fetching the first sector of the boot device (usually the <span class="bold">hard drive</span>) and jumping to it.
                            <div class="frame-highlight">
                                <p>The <span class="bold">bootloader</span> is a small program responsible for loading the kernel into the RAM. It contains <span class="bold">various information</span> about the kernel such as its location on the disk, its size, etc.
                                    In this project, I will be using <span class="bold">GRUB</span> as bootloader. It is a tool from the <span class="bold">GNU project</span> and a <span class="bold">multiboot compliant</span> bootloader.
                                </p>
                            </div>
                            Finally, the bootloader loads the kernel into the RAM and jumps to it. After this, one problem remains: the <span class="bold">stack pointer (ESP)</span> is not initialized. However, C/C++ programs expect this pointer to be initialized when the program starts.
                            To initialize it, we need to create a <span class="bold">assembly file (loader.s)</span> that will initialize this pointer and jump to the <span class="bold">kernel's entry point</span>.
                            On the other hand, the kernel program will be likely written in <span class="bold">C++ language</span>. Hence, we will end up with 2 files: a <span class="bold">loader.s</span> file and a <span class="bold">kernel.cpp</span> file.
                            Since those are from different natures (assembler and C++), we need to find a way to "merge" them. To do that, we will be using a <span class="bold">linker</span>.
                            As a result, we will build both files into <span class="bold">object files (.o)</span> and link them using the linker program <span class="bold">ld</span>. All of this is discussed <a href="#makefile">further</a>.
                            You can view a summary illustration of the booting process below: 
                        </p>

                    <p>For now, my directory setup consists of 4 files: a <span class="bold">kernel.cpp</span> file, a <span class="bold">linker.ld</span> file, a <span class="bold">Makefile</span> and a <span class="bold">loader.s</span> file. Let's explore each one of them below.</p>
                    <div> <h4>Freestanding environment</h4>
                        <p>The minimal kernel I am aiming to build will be in a <span class="bold">freestanding</span> (as opposed to hosted) environment, meaning that there is <span class="bold">no C standard library</span> I can link to and no <span class="bold">operating system</span> to rely on yet.
                        </p>

                            <p>Only some header files such as < stdbool.h >, < stddef.h > and others are available as they are part of the compiler itself.</p>
                        </div>
                        <p>However, those freestanding headers only provide macros and data types. Therefore, all C standard functions such as printf(), strlen(), strcmp() and many more, I will have to write those myself.</p>

                <div id="makefile"> <h3>Makefile</h3>
                    <p>I will be using <span class="bold">C++</span> to program my operating system. The compilation process encompasses several steps and uses different tools.
                        I will be working with the <span class="bold">GNU Make</span> toolset to automate the build process. The GNU suite includes multiple tools such as:

                        Then, we will be creating the actual binary (or executable file) from the compiled object files.
                        Makefile uses a specific syntax to build files (see below). The <span class="bold">'\t'</span> means that a tabulation is required for the Makefile to work.

                    <p>There are some issues we need to sort out that require assemby code. Firstly, the stack pointer has to be initialized. Secondly, when the bootloader loads the kernel into the RAM,
                        it searches for so-called <span class="bold">magic numbers</span> (known as a multiboot header), that allow it to recognize the kernel as <span class="bold">multiboot compatible</span>.
                        Hence, it knows how to load the kernel. The multiboot header must be <span class="bold">very early in the kernel binary</span>, or the bootloader will fail to recognize us.

                        <p>A <span class="bold">Magic number</span> is a sequence of few bytes likely located at the beginning of a file which are <span class="bold">unique</span> to a particular file type.

                    <p>Thirdly, the bootloader will automatically forward us important information. It will notably make the EAX register point to the <span class="bold">Multiboot information structure</span>
                        and the EBX register point to the <span class="bold">Magic number</span>. Knowing that, we could benefit from this to store those values by pushing them on the kernel's stack.
                        Eventually, the <span class="bold">loader.s</span> file's goals are:

                <div> <h3>kernel.cpp file</h3>
                    <p>As stated before, for this version of my kernel I just want to <span class="bold">print out some text on the screen</span>. In a traditional manner, this comes really easy as our program runs within an OS (say Linux) that can <span class="bold">dynamically link the glibc library to the program</span>.
                        In my case, I have <span class="bold">neither an OS, nor an external library</span> to link to. Therefore, I need to write <span class="bold">my own printf function</span>. It appears that at the <span class="bold">address 0xB8000</span>, there is a <span class="bold">memory-mapped VGA buffer</span>.
                        This means that all bytes written starting from this address will be displayed on the screen.
                    </p>
                    <div class="frame-highlight">
                        <p>It is important to note that I have to let a byte space between each byte written. Indeed, for each character printed out, we can tweak their foreground and background color using this byte in-between. The illustration below shows it.</p>
                    </div>
                    <p>Also, you will notice that I wrote <span class="bold">extern "C"</span> before the main function definition. This intends to tell the compiler to discard <span class="bold">name mangling</span> (C++ feature) but instead to take the <span class="bold">C linkage conventions</span>
                        so that it can recognize the function during linkage process.
                    </p>
                    <div class="frame-highlight">
                        <p><span class="bold">Name mangling</span> is a C++ compilation convention. C++ includes <span class="bold">function overloading and namespaces</span>, which means that functions with the same name can exist. They can have <span class="bold">different return types and arguments</span>.
                            Therefore, the C++ compiler would include type information in the assembly name by <span class="bold">adding new symbols</span> (name-mangling) that allows the linker to differentiate between functions that have the same name.

                    <p>For this file, I made some extra researches because it was really obscure to me. The role of the linker is to determine how the kernel's sections will be organized in memory when it is loaded and executed.
                        This is done by the <span class="bold">SECTIONS</span> part. I will try to explain each line's purpose.
