                    <h3>In this section, I go more in depth about the concepts I have learnt and the networking tools I used during the lab sessions.</h3>

                <div class="session"> <div class="label"> <h2>1. Parallelism</h2> </div>
                    <div> <h4>1.1 Managing resources with pipes</h4>
                        <p>A <span class="bold">file descriptor (fd)</span> is a number which identifies a specific <span class="bold">pipe</span>.
                            A <span class="bold">pipe</span> is a key concept in communication systems. It is a way to write or read from various ressources.
                            It is also a way to communicate between processes. By default, there are already 3 file descriptors open: STDIN_FILENO, STDOUT_FILENO, STDERR_FILENO.
                            To write in a specific pipe, we use the C function <span class="bold">write</span> and to read from a specific pipe, we use the C function <span class="bold">read</span>.
                        </p>
                        <div class="linux-terminal">
                            <div>$ man 2 [write/read/open/close]</div>
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            It is important to note that in an Unix-like environment, every is considered as being a file. In the socket section, we will see that fil descriptors are used to identify sockets.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div> <h4>1.2 Process</h4>
                        <p>A <span class="bold">process</span> (also called task or thread) can be seen as a function that executes a particular task.
                            A <span class="bold">program</span> is a collection of tasks. The point of threads is that, we may need to run several in parallel to achieve different tasks simultaneously.
                            To create a process direclty from the main process (or any other process), we use the C function <span class="bold">fork</span>. A new thread, completely independent from the original one is created.
                            The new process is called the <span class="bold">child process</span> and the original process is called the <span class="bold">parent process</span>. Each process is identified by unique
                            <span class="bold">PID (Process IDentifier)</span>. The child process is attributed a new PID (0) but its parent process keeps its PID.
                        </p>
                        <div class="linux-terminal">
                            <div>$ man 2 [fork/waitpid/exit]</div>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div> <h4>1.3 Communication inter-process</h4>
                        <p>Now that we have seen how to write to or read from a pipe (identified by a file descriptor) and we are more familiar with the notion of thread, we can bind them together
                            and try to have a pipe connect 2 processes. One would read from the pipe and the second one would write to it. To do so, we use the C function <span class="bold">pipe</span>.
                        </p>
                        <div class="linux-terminal">
                            <div>$ man 2 [pipe]</div>
                        </div>
                        <p>We can also make a <span class="bold">pipe redirection (or process overlapping)</span>. This a way of linking 2 file descriptors. To do so, we use the C function <span class="bold">dup2</span>.
                            The first argument is the file descriptor we want to duplicate and the second argument is the file descriptor we want to link it to.
                        </p>
                        <div class="linux-terminal">
                            <div>$ man 2 [dup2/exec]</div>
                        </div>
                        <div class="frame-highlight">
                            <p>To open a pipe in Bash, we use the '<span class="bold">|</span>' symbol. It redirects the output (STDOUT_FILENO) of the first command to the input (STDOUT_FILENO) for the next command.
                                For instance, <span class="bold">ls | grep "file"</span> will list all the files in the current directory and then search for the word "file" in the output of the previous command.
                            </p>
                        </div>
                    </div>

                    <div> <h4>1.4 Issues</h4>
                        <p>This Multi-threading paradigm brings with it some issues such as the <span class="bold">starvation problem</span>, in which a thread monopolizes the resources.
                            Another issue is the <span class="bold">deadlock problem</span>, in which two threads are waiting for each other to finish their tasks.
                            To counter these issues, we use <span class="bold">mutexes</span> (mutual exclusion) and <span class="bold">semaphores</span>. They play the role of guardian of the critical or shared
                            resource with a system of locks and keys.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <div class="session"> <div class="label"> <h2>2. Sockets</h2> </div>
                    <p>A socket is a <span class="bold">communication point</span> that binds an IP address and a port number. There exist sockets at different levels of the OSI model.
                        We will see in the encryption session that raw sockets are used to send and receive packets at the <span class="bold">network layer</span>.
                        <span class="bold">UDP (User Datagram Protocol)</span>  is a <span class="bold">connectionless</span> protocol, in which the sender does not wait for client's acknowledgment.
                        <span class="bold">TCP (Transport Communication Protocol)</span> is a <span class="bold">connection-oriented</span> protocol, in which the sender does wait for client's acknowledgment.
                        If it does not get any acknowledgment back, it will send the packet again.
                    </p>
                    <img class="sockets-img" src="images/network/sockets.svg" alt="sockets">
                    <p>The flow charts above describes a simple case of communication between a server and a client for <span class="bold">TCP</span> and <span class="bold">UDP</span>.
                        We can notice that these protocols are slighlty different. Indeed, <span class="bold">TCP</span> requires one step more than <span class="bold">UDP</span> to establish a connection between the client and the server. 
                        This involves that after having created the socket and bound it, the server listens to any connection request on a <span class="bold">listen socket</span>.
                        Once a request received, the server accepts and creates a new socket, called the <span class="bold">dialogue socket (circled in red)</span> provided by the client.
                        Now, both the server and the client have a socket to communicate with each other.
                    </p>
                    <p>By issuing the command <span class="inline-terminal">ss -pan[u/t]</span> in the terminal, we can see all our current UDP and TCP connections. In lab sessionw, we created both
                        a <span class="bold">UDP</span> and <span class="bold">TCP server</span> and a <span class="bold">UDP</span> and <span class="bold">TCP client</span> in C. The image below shows
                        all TCP connections my computer after running a local server and some clients with ncat. Since I only have my laptop to make tests, I had to run the TCP server and TCP clients on the same machine.
                    </p>
                    <img src="images/network/tcp_table.PNG" alt="tcp_table">
                    <p>First, we can notice the <span class="bold">LISTEN TCP servers</span> at ports 1234 (txt communication) and 5678 (binary communication). They are identified by a <span class="bold">file descriptor (fd)</span>,
                        which means that in linux <span class="bold">writing in a file and in a socket works the same</span>. The <span class="bold">PID (Process IDentifier)</span> identifies the thread that runs the server.
