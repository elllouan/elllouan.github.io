                    <h2 class="introduction-to-Haption">Introduction to Haption</h2>
                    <p>Haption is a robotics company founded in 2001 located at Soulgé-Sur-Ouette in Mayenne (53). They develop force-feedback
                        devices. Along building and selling their devices, they also thought up their own software API (RaptorAPI).
                        Their are mostly known for their devices "Virtuose" that offer a force-feedback effort for 3 or 6 degrees of freedom along translations
                        and rotations. They sell two different formats of Virtuose, namely the "Standard" version and the "Desktop" a smaller version.
                        Their devices are used in a wide range of nuclear, robotics, health and industry applications.
                        The site consists of roughly 15 employees and a few commercials scattered around the globe.
                        There is also another site in Germany but this one consists of only one person, Jérôme, chief of the software department.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="my-mission">My mission at Haption</h2>
                    <p>I was in charge of developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application in C++. The purpose of this application was to run some
                        portions of code of their newly developed API, namely RaptorAPI, in order to test the accuracy and well functioning of the devices.
                        The ultimate goal was to incorporate tests of a validation test bench (done by another internee) so that the company and clients can
                        conduct them in an easier way thanks to the help of a user-friendly graphical interface.
