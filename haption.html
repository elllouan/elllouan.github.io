            <h3 style="text-align: center;">As part of my engineering studies, I had to do a 2-month internship during the summer 2023.
                This page talks about this internship and introduces briefly the company, my mission there and my conclusion.</h3>

                    <h2 class="introduction-to-Haption">Introduction to Haption</h2>
                    <p>Haption is a robotics company founded in 2001 located at Soulgé-Sur-Ouette in Mayenne (53). They develop force-feedback
                        devices. Along building and selling their devices, they also thought up their own software API (RaptorAPI).
                        Their are mostly known for their devices "Virtuose" that offer a force-feedback effort for 3 or 6 degrees of freedom along translations
                        and rotations. They sell two different formats of Virtuose, namely the "Standard" version and the "Desktop" a smaller version.
                        Their devices are used in a wide range of nuclear, robotics, health and industry applications.
                        The site consists of roughly 15 employees and a few commercials scattered around the globe.
                        There is also another site in Germany but this one consists of only one person, Jérôme, chief of the software department.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="my-mission">My mission at Haption</h2>
                    <p>I was in charge of developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application in C++. The purpose of this application was to run some
                        portions of code for their newly developed API, namely "RaptorAPI", in order to test the accuracy and well functioning of their devices.
                        The ultimate goal was to incorporate a validation test bench (done by another internee) so that the company and clients would be able to
                        conduct tests in an easier way through a user-friendly graphical interface.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="technical-description">Technical description</h2>
                    <p>When I arrived at the end of June, there was a first version of the GUI but this version was really skimpy.
                        The code was distributed only over 2 classes and the interface was not that intuitive and also error-prone.
                        To give a clear overview of the work I accomplished, I split my whole mission into multiple tasks that I identified:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accomodate to my new environment</li>
                        <p>First off, I needed to clearly understand the purpose of my mission here. I was assigned a spot inside the study office.
                            Then, for the first 2-or-so weeks I mostly dedicated my time to get familiar with the RaptorAPI and also with the whole setup.</p>
                        <li>Learn how to build a project with CMake</li>
                        <p>I quickly found out that I will need to use CMake to handle the build process of my project. It was a great opportunity to learn this meta-builder language
                            and improve my knowledge of the compiler, linker, depdendencies and how they are linked to one another. I learnt a lot about CMake (but still a big part remains to be learnt :)).</p>
                        <li>Develop the GUI further</li>
                        <p>The GUI was programmed using <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">DearImGui</a>. This is an open-source project available on GitHub.
                            When I arrived the project consisted of only 2 classes and was not fully using the Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP).
                            I used OOP, rearanged the graphical aspect, incorporated tests, made the app cross-platform. On top of that, I had to cope with some constraints introduced by the device itself.
                            There was a watchdog and at any given moment an error could occur. I also had to consider this, thereby improving the robustness of the application.</p>
                        <li>Implement a configuration file to save settings</li>
                        <p>I used YAML files to save user settings.</p>
                        <li>Write documentation and guidance</li>
                        <p>To not lose all my throughput, I thought that it would be relevant to write a documentation for the Haption software team, as they will
                            probably improve the GUI in the future. This is just the beginning of the project.  
                        </p>
                    </ul>    
                    
                    <p>
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="conclusion">Learning outcomes</h2>
                    <p>I would like to thank the whole Haption team and employees. They were really welcoming and pleasing to work with. The company had an extremely good atmosphere conducive
                        to working efficiently. Even-though my original internship's subject was discarded, I took pleasure to put my C++ knowledge into practice. Also, I am
                        satisfied that we gave me the opportunity to enhance my programmation skills (CMake, SQL, YAML, Git, VS Code) and personal skills (autonomy, team work). Overall, it was great
                        first professional experience and I hope to live a similar experience again in the future.
                    </p>
