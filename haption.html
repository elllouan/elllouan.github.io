                    <h2 class="introduction-to-Haption">Introduction to Haption</h2>
                    <p>Haption is a robotics company founded in 2001 located at Soulgé-Sur-Ouette in Mayenne (53). They develop force-feedback
                        devices. Along building and selling their devices, they also thought up their own software API (RaptorAPI).
                        Their are mostly known for their devices "Virtuose" that offer a force-feedback effort for 3 or 6 degrees of freedom along translations
                        and rotations. They sell two different formats of Virtuose, namely the "Standard" version and the "Desktop" a smaller version.
                        Their devices are used in a wide range of nuclear, robotics, health and industry applications.
                        The site consists of roughly 15 employees and a few commercials scattered around the globe.
                        There is also another site in Germany but this one consists of only one person, Jérôme, chief of the software department.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="my-mission">My mission at Haption</h2>
                    <p>I was in charge of developing a Graphical User Interface (GUI) application in C++. The purpose of this application was to run some
                        portions of code of their newly developed API, namely RaptorAPI, in order to test the accuracy and well functioning of the devices.
                        The ultimate goal was to incorporate tests of a validation test bench (done by another internee) so that the company and clients can
                        conduct them in an easier way thanks to the help of a user-friendly graphical interface.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="technical-description">Technical description</h2>
                    <p>When I arrived at the end of June, there was a first version of the GUI but this version was really skimpy. 
                        To give a clear overview of the work I accomplished, I split my whole work into multiple tasks that I identified:</p> 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accomodate to my new environment</li>
                        <p>First off, I needed to clearly understand the purpose of my mission here. I was assigned a spot inside the study office.
                            Then, for the first 2 or so weeks I mostly dedicated my time to get familiar with the RaptorAPI and also to the whole setup.</p>
                        <li>Learn how to build a project with CMake</li>
                        <p>I quickly found out that I would need to use CMake to handle the build process of my project. It was a great opportunity to learn
                            about compiler, linker, depdendencies and how they are linked to one another. I learnt a lot about CMake and you can check my tutorial to see more.</p>
                        <li>Develop the GUI further</li>
                        <p>The GUI was programmed using <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">DearImGui</a>. This is an open-source project available on
                            GitHub. When I arrived the project consisted of only 2 classes and was not fully using the Object-Oriented Paradigm (OOP).
                            Use OOP, rearange the graphical aspect, incorporate tests, Have the app cross-platform, </p>
                        <li>Implement a configuration file to save settings</li>
                        <p>First thought of a database, then yaml </p>
                        <li>Write documentation and guidance</li>
                        <p>To not lose all my throughput, I considered that I had to write a documentation for the Haption software team, as they will
                            probably improve the GUI. This is just the beginning of the project    
                        </p>
                    </ul>    
                    
                    <p>
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="conclusion">Learning outcomes</h2>
                    <p>
                    </p>

                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>I would like to thank the whole Haption team that was really welcoming and pleasing to work with. The company gives off an extremely good atmosphere conducive
                        to working efficiently. Even-though my original internship's subject was not considered, I took pleasure to put my C++ knowledge into practice. Also, I am
                        satisfied that I was able to enhance my programmation skills (CMake, SQL, YAML, Git, VS Code) and personal skills (autonomy, team work). Overall, it was great
                        first professional experience and I hope to live a such experience again in the future.   
                        
                    </p>
