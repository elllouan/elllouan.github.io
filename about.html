                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>As I am entering my fourth year in my engineering studies, I realised that I needed to bring more tangibility into my work by documenting it.
                        My mindset could be summarized in these words:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> <span class="mark">Curiosity:</span> Especially for the fields of embedded systems.</li>
                        <li> <span class="mark">Proactivity:</span> Being inquisitive and asking for feedback.</li>
                        <li> <span class="mark">Resourceful:</span> Being able to self-teach or make effective researchs on a subject or a topic when necessary.</li>
                        <li> <span class="mark">Persistence:</span> Trying as much as possible to build a deep and long-term knowledge.</li>
                        <li> <span class="mark">Reflective:</span> Leveraging my past experiences to serve at best my current purposes.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>I wish to specialize in the field of embedded and signal/image processing systems.
                    I am really interested in signal/image processing (my specialization this year), control theory and low-level programmation (assembly, C, C++).
                    In parallel, I am carrying out a double-diploma Management and Administration of Companys (MAE) for the next 2 years at the IAE of Brest.
                    By doing so, I yearn for expanding my skills beyond my technical knowledge.
                    Nowadays, I think it is relavant for an enginner to be able to comprehend thoroughly the company world, to develop social skills as they are essential
                    in enhancing team work, well-being, performance and productivity.
                    </p>
                    <p>On a more personal standpoint, I like reading. I am especially interested in current stakes that human kind is facing. I am currenlty reading GÃ¼nther Anders
                        <span class="mark">"The obscolescense of the human kind"</span> and I wish to talk about it in a podcast episode when I will be done. Among other things,
                        I am sensitive to the environmental crisis and the impact of new technology in our lives. Otherwise, I practise sport such as running, fitness or climbing.</p>
