            <h2>Work philosophy</h2>
            <p>As I am entering my fourth year in my engineering studies, I realised that I needed to bring more tangibility into my work by documenting it.
                My mindset could be summarized in these words:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Curiosity: Especially for the fields of electronics and computer engineering.</li>
                <li>Proactivity: Being inquisitive and asking for feedback.</li>
                <li>Resourceful: Being able to self-teach or make effective researchs on subjects or topics when necessary.</li>
                <li>Persistence: Trying as much as possible to build a deep and long-term knowledge.</li>
                <li>Reflective: Leveraging my past experiences to serve better my current purpose. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>I wish to steer my studies more in the field of embedded systems.
            I am really interested in signal processing (my major this year), control theory, low-level programmation and electronics.
            In parallel to my engineering studies, I will also be studying management (MAE) for the next 2 years at the Brest IAE as part of a double-diploma master cursus.
            By doing so, I yearn to expand my skills beyond my technical and scientific knowledge.
            Nowadays, I think that an enginner should also be considering social skills as they are essential in enhancing team work, well-being, performance and productivity.</p>
