            <div> <h3>Convolution</h3>
                First off, I would like to mention this wonderful video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IaSGqQa5O-M" target="_blank">3Blue1Brown</a>.
                There I learnt a lot and improve my understanding about the role that convolution plays in probability and image processing.
                To get started, I will try to summarize quickly what it is explained in this video.
                
                <div> <h4>Discrete convolution</h4>
                    <p>We can start by focusing on the discrete case which (in my opinion) brings the main idea of why we use convolution in probability.
                        The formula goes \[ (f(n)*g(n))(s) = \sum^{N}_{n=0} f(n) g(s-n) \]
                        Here \(f(n)\) and \(g(m)\) are functions representing the probability of a random discrete variable.
                        So if we try to think this through, we can notice that a new variable appeared \(s\) and also we do this weird operation consisting of multiplying \(g(s-n)\) with \(f(n)\).
                    </p>
                    <p>Now let's image I want to determine the probability that 2 consecutive and independent events (let's say \( n+m=5 \)) occur.
                        To be easier, let's consider that \(n\) and \(m\) are variables representing the face of a dice.
                        We need to consider all possibilities, such as \(n=1\) and \(m=4\), \(n=2\) and \(m=3\) and so on. So we end up adding these probabilities:
                        \(f(n=1) \times g(m=4) + f(n=2) \times g(m=3) + f(n=3) \times g(m=2) ... \). If we generalize this operation to all other possible combinaisons of events \( n+m=s \),
                        where \(s\) can take any possible value an event can take (in our case, from 1 to 6).
                        You may have understood it, \(s\) represents the combinaison of two successive and independent events \(n\) and \(m\). So to get back to the example,
                        the probability that we get a total of 5 after having thrown the dice twice can be written as follows:
                        \[ P(5) = \sum^{6}_{n=1} f(n) g(5-n) = f(n=1) \times g(m=4) + f(n=2) \times g(m=3) + ... + f(n=4) \times g(m=1) \]
                        If we repeat this operation for each value of \(s\), we get a function of \(s\) where the image represents the probability that \(s=n+m\) occurs.
                    </p>
                </div>
                
                <div> <h4>Continuous convolution</h4>
                    <p>The formula goes \[ (f(x)*g(x))(s) = \int^{+\infty}_{-\infty} f(x) g(s-x) dx \]
                        Here \(f(x)\) and \(g(y)\) are functions representing the probability density of a random variable.
                        The outcome of this convolution operation is a new function \(h(s)\), called the probability density function,
                        where \(s\) represents the random variable \(X+Y\) and its image represents the probability (density) that \(P_X + P_P\) occurs.
                        The concept is basically the same, since we are in a contiuous set of random variables,
                        we just expand the discrete case \(\sum\) to the continuous case \(\int\), which means we consider the area under the curve.
